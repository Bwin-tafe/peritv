Rather than continuing down this path of optimism & philanthropy, Ultima V asks the question: what happens when virtue is made mandatory?\n\nIn this episode of the Ultima Retrospective, we take a look at Origin System's late 1980's growing pains, their competition, and of course, Ultima V: Warriors of Destiny.\n\nThis is the 4th video in my Ultima Retrospective series.

Graphics, sound, computing power - quality standards were changing every day, and Ultima would have to change with them. In the process, Origin would learn hard lessons, celebrate numerous victories, and establish the career of (yet another) industry legend.\n\nThis is the 6th video in my Ultima Retrospective series.

While Richard Garriott worked on Ultima VII, several small teams within Origin would repurpose the Ultima VI engine, taking the series back to its pulpy roots. \n\nThe fruits of this labor were Savage Empire and Martian Dreams - the Worlds of Ultima Duology. This pair of oft-forgotten games had as much in common with point & click adventures of the time as it did with Ultima. In this video, we'll be taking a look at these games, as well as the historical context that surrounds them.\n\nThis is the 7th video in my Ultima Retrospective series.

With the release of games like Wolfenstein 3D, Alone in the Dark, and Virtua Racing, the foundation for a 3D-centric future was being established, and it showed no signs of slowing down.\n\nThis very year, Origin Systems approached Blue Sky Productions with a simple proposal: to develop the first 3D entry in the legendary Ultima series. The resulting game may not have enjoyed the limelight the way its 3D contemporaries did, but its significance and influence can't be overstated.\n\nThe story of Ultima Underworld is the story of a new frontier in computer graphics. It's the story of one of the greatest PC game development studios in history. It's the story of the Immersive Simulation, and that's a story worth telling.\n\nThank you to Alexey Gorboot for designing the thumbnail to this video!

This would have been a challenge even for a traditional 2D CRPG, but the people at Looking Glass were nothing if not ambitious.\n\nThe result was Ultima Underworld II: Labyrinth of Worlds, a game frequently written off by onlookers as derivative, sloppy, and overly difficult. But the reality of Underworld II is far more complex. Did the pressure of ambition and ruthless time crunch create another diamond?

Thanks for sponsoring my PS1 cheat codes video!\nLet's dive headfirst into the ridiculous world of PlayStation 1 cheat codes \u2014 back when games didn\u2019t hold your hand and cheat books were passed down from older siblings and obscure game forums. From infinite ammo to unlocking secret characters, we're cracking open the classics and testing out the most ridiculous, game-breaking, and downright bizarre cheats from your favorite PS1 titles. Games like Grand Theft Auto, Tomb Raider, Crash Bandicoot, Tony Hawk\u2019s Pro Skater 2, Tekken 3, and Metal Gear Solid all had crazy hacks back when games were more fun. Whether you grew up with these or you're just curious what we used to get up to before DLC existed, you're in for a nostalgia-packed trip.

Crash Bash Caddicarus. Ever since the original game review when Caddy still did game reviews very similar to JonTron back in 2012 up until Caddy Plays Crash Bash where he got to Crash Bash 200 percent by not even doing a Crash Bash speedrun or a Crash Bash speed run, everyone hasn't been able to remove the relationship between Caddy and the worst Crash Bandicoot party game Crash Bash. Actually that's too harsh, I'd say one of the worst Crash Bandicoot games from the void of bad Crash Bandicoot games is probably Crash Boom Bang DS gameplay and Crash Boom Bang DS review, but after going for the Crash Bash ending by completing Crash Bash, you'll see exactly why it's as hated as it is. Going after all crystals and all gems and all gold relics and all platinum relics is going to be explained in agonizing detail during this video, and you'll see all of the worst crystal challenges, worst gem challenges and worst relic challenges. In this Crash Bash review with Crash Bash gameplay you'll see lots of Crash Bash PS1 on the original PlayStation. Arguably too much PS1. I played the entire game on my region free PS2 for the most authentic experience and not emulated at all, meaning I had to sit there through all of the Crash Bash loading music as it read it raw from the disc itself - and despite everything I do in this video, the Crash Bash region differences did allow for me to use Crash Bash cheat codes or Crash Bash cheats that only work via the original first edition Crash Bash PAL black label copy. However, you can also use the Crash Bash demo cheat to gain access to the Crash Bash full game and see the Crash Bash all minigames - doable either from the Spyro 3 Crash Bash demo with the Spyro 3 cheat codes and Spyro 3 cheats, or the classic PS1 demo disc music on the PS1 demo disc Crash Bandicoot method in order to access the Crash Bash debug menu. Luckily at least the Crash Bash music on Crash Bash PS1 is great stuff and I recommend you searching for the Crash Bash OST whenever you can to hear how good it is - I just do NOT recommend you trying to get Crash Bash 200 or Crash Bash 200%. Actually scratch that, don't even try Crash Bash 100% and Crash Bash 100. It's not worth it, not even with the Crash Bash 2 player adventure mode to get you the very few unique Crash Bash cutscenes and 1 additional bonus boss level from the Crash Bash all bosses after Crash Bash Oxide Ride should close the whole game off. I am done with Crash Bash and I can't wait to just go back to any Mario Party - whether it be Mario Party N64 or Mario Party 2 N64 or Mario Party 3 N64, or even the newest ones on the Nintendo Switch such as Mario Party Superstars or the upcoming Mario games Super Mario Party Jamboree review. I can recommend literally ANY party game over this, even Sonic Shuffle gameplay from Sonic Shuffle Dreamcast. If you look at another Crash Bandicoot review online featuring Crash Bandicoot gameplay you may even notice that much like the N Sane Trilogy not made by Naughty Dog, Crash Bash Remake should exist. I don't think it should happen - no Crash Bash PS4 or Crash Bash PS5 or even a Crash Bash 2 - let it go. I wasn't even that into Crash Team Rumble gameplay and so didn't bother with a Crash Team Rumble review. Yes, I said Crash Team Rumble and not Crash Team Racing PS1 with Crash Team Racing gameplay - one of the best PlayStation games of all time. I don't think Crash Bash is one of the worst PlayStation games of all times but as far as retro games go in the retro gaming community, until you've tried to complete Crash Bash, you have no idea.

It was the EyeToy. Or the Eye Toy, whatever you wanna call it. EyeToy Kinect. The PS2 EyeToy. And the Playstation 2 EyeToy was revolutionary for the time despite some of the worst PS2 games of all time. It eventually lead the way for the PlayStation Move and PlayStation Eye with PSVR and PlayStation VR review - but more importantly it gave us some of the best PS2 games of all time like EyeToy Play gameplay and EyeToy Play Groove gameplay. I would say EyeToy Play Sports gameplay but lets be honest, Wii Sports review and Wii Sports gameplay was probably better. There was even EyeToy Play 2 gameplay and EyeToy Play 3 gameplay so you can tell Eye Toy was popular at least. It even got one of those Disney games with Disney Move gameplay. EyeToy Kinetic gameplay was also a thing which would eventually become Kinect Get Fit with Mel B and the spiritual predecessor to Sonic Free Riders, EyeToy Antigrav gameplay - not to mention SpyToy gameplay also known as EyeToy Operation Spy gameplay. So here in this EyeToy review or Eye Toy review for PS2, you'll see all that PlayStation review stuff you'd expect but also more motion controls than ever before. There might even be a Bob the Builder theme song from the Bob the Builder intro or even Thomas and Friends PS2 with the slightly updated Thomas the Tank Engine theme song from the modern Thomas the Tank Engine intro. Ape Escape PS2 is here but not Ape Escape 2 gameplay or Ape Escape 3 gameplay with the incredible Ape Escape 2 OST and Ape Escape 3 OST but actually the EyeToy Monkey Mania gameplay and of course who can forget EyeToy window cleaning - I swear that's all anybody remembers from PlayStation 2 Eye Toy - the EyeToy cleaning windows minigame from EyeToy Play review. For anybody upset with Star Wars Kinect review from the Xbox Kinect Star Wars review you can also find EyeToy Play Hero gameplay with it's nifty little green sword and even the Pom Pom Party game - yes, EyeToy Play Pom Pom Party gameplay. EyeToy Pom Poms. EyeToy Pompoms. I don't even know what I'm typing. Oh yes - there's also more Phoenix Games that Caddicarus is infamous for with Caddicarus Phoenix Games review - you've seen Dalmatians 3 review, you've seen Snow White and the 7 Clever Boys review, and how here is Phoenix Games EyeToy with Clumsy Shumsy PS2 gameplay from a Clumsy Shumsy review. A lot went into this one, including a last-minute improv bit with me and Spons because the sponsor took too long. Yay! Wait a minute, Bob the Builder PS2 is a thing. And Thomas the Tank Engine PS2 is a thing. Oh no. But that's okay - there's also EyeToy Groove OST which is surprisingly one of my favourite dance games, and let's not forget about Sonic the Hedgehog in Sega Superstars. Sega Superstars EyeToy review and Sega Superstars PS2 gameplay is some of the best that EyeToy has to offer - go and get Sega Superstars EyeToy gameplay.\n\nWatch more comedy game reviews like my EyeToy review and PS2 review on my channel! | Caddicarus\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/Caddicarus\n\n#Eyetoy #playstation #PS2", "duration": 8075.0, "thumbnail": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EoylXwZPCms/maxresdefault.jpg", "tags": ["playlist: The Caddicarus Show"], "series": "none", "episode": 3, "category": "essay"}, {"id": "W6qu0t6_UFM", "author": "Caddicarus", "title": "The Scary World of Viral YouTube Horror Games - Caddicarus", "description": "Help Spons get back in his egg from these horror games and download Honkai: Star Rail using my link: https://hoyo.link/a6ceFDCL , and get an extra 50 Stellar Jades using redeem code: KBQBEP3L8823 .

The most viral videos of the week didn\u2019t exist, maybe even the concept of funny viral videos or scary viral videos didn\u2019t exist either. But then all of a sudden, YouTube happened, and then the biggest let\u2019s play channels kicked off into the stratosphere with a horror game playthrough. JackSepticEye horror games and Markiplier horror games compilation videos and walkthrough videos went massive and caused a new surge of the best indie games of all time, or in some cases the worst indie games of all time, to come up into the spotlight - which leads us to today\u2019s Caddy video. Amnesia the Dark Descent reaction videos and Amnesia walkthrough videos showing Amnesia the Dark Descent gameplay were one of the first indie horror games to go viral from PewDiePie and every other giant streamer, and eventually this lead to Amnesia the Dark Descent review videos and then even more free horror games getting popularity - but why? Jim Caddick is going to try answering that question, badly. But by trying that he will show off SCP Containment Breach walkthrough and SCP Containment Breach review alongside every SCP Containment Breach jump scare and more underground classics like Yume Nikki review and Yume Nikki soundtrack - and who can possibly forget the infamous Slender Man, or Slenderman, depending on where you see him in the world of scariest creepypastas and other creepypasta reading channels. Slender the Eight Pages full game and Slender the 8 Pages walkthrough videos went viral too, and Caddty even did a Slender review back in 2012. It was terrible, don\u2019t watch it. He was scared of slenderman. Luckily though he isn\u2019t anymore, and also isn\u2019t freaked out by Slender the Arrival review and Slender the Arrival walkthrough, it\u2019s just another jumpscare game fad. But then it all rounds off eventually with a trip down Outlast review with Outlast gameplay and Outlast walkthrough for PS4 and Xbox, and then the one we\u2019re all waiting for, Five Nights at Freddy\u2019s. Or FNAF review, if you want to get lazy. And I am lazy - so FNAF 1, FNAF 2 and FNAF 3 it is. We haven\u2019t got time to spell the whole FNAF gameplay words out, the FNAF movie trailer is out and the Five Nights at Freddy\u2019s movie itself is now out in cinemas. Go and watch the Five Nights and Freddy\u2019s trailer, see what you think. And maybe Spons will ruin everything as he always does, what is Caddicarus Spons anyway? There\u2019ll also be FNAF 2 review and FNAF 3 review - you could almost look at it like a Five Nights at Freddy\u2019s retrospective, or FNAF retrospective. I don\u2019t like that word. I\u2019m calling them FANF. Leave me alone. Happy Halloween - I haven\u2019t done a Caddicarus Halloween Special for many years and I hope it\u2019s everything you wanted.\n\nWatch more comedy game reviews like my horror game review on my channel! | Caddicarus\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/Caddicarus\n#caddicarus #horrorgaming #gaming #fnaf", "duration": 4209.0, "thumbnail": null, "tags": ["playlist: The Caddicarus Show"], "series": "none", "episode": 4, "category": "essay"}, {"id": "rjG_vErbAJM", "author": "Caddicarus", "title": "The Ripoff World of Crash Bandicoot Merchandise - Caddicarus", "description": "Caddy spends thousands on a load of orange plastic (I love you Crash Bandicoot).

Crash Bandicoot merchandise. You wouldn't think there would be that much, but it turns out there is a LOT of Crash Bandicoot merch, and it set Caddicarus back a few thousand pounds because of how rare they are, or how much or a rip off they are, or ripoff, if you so please. There's a few Crash Bandicoot limited edition or Crash Bandicoot deluxe edition merch, but today we're sticking with the outside video game stuff, so no N Sane Trilogy steel box or Crash Bandicoot 4 steel box this time. We're also not looking at bootleg merchandise, even though there is a LOT of Crash Bandicoot bootlegs and Crash Bandicoot bootleg merch - particularly with Fake Crash, who would go on to be an unlockable character in Crash Team Racing and even as a Fake Crash boss in N Tranced for the GBA, or Gameboy Advance, or Crash Bandicoot 2 Game Boy Advance, whatever tickles your fancy. There are more Crash Bandicoot toys than you can possibly imagine from Crash Bandicoot Funko Pop Vinyl figures from the Funko Pop collection even all the way to the original retro Crash Bandicoot ReSaurus toys from the late 1990s. Vinyl figures from Crash Bandicoot 4 YouTooz, Spyro Hot Wheels and Crash Bandicoot Hot Wheels car and even Crash Bandicoot G Fuel will make an appearance with the Sam Widge cooking show, alongside a special loot crate Crash Bandicoot merch box unboxing video from Long Dennis. You might also see some Oney Plays Crash Bandicoot in here. Maybe even an Oney Plays WOAH. Wait and see.

I don\u2019t mean the PS5 trailer or Xbox trailer that you\u2019d see today - they used to put new game trailers on TV. And in print for video game magazines, but that didn\u2019t sound good as a title. Join Caddy as he dives into video game commercials from all of your favorites - Nintendo, PlayStation, Xbox, Microsoft, Sega - the lot. Some of the video game adverts are for consoles, some of the video game ads are for games. Some of the video game TV adverts are region exclusive such as Japanese, and some of the video game TV ads are supposed to be for games or consoles but then end up being the trippiest commercials or even the scariest commercials for absolutely no reason. Nintendo commercials are usually safe aside from exceptions like the Yoshi\u2019s Island commercial, and PlayStation go all out crazy with most of their commercials and printed magazine ads like with the PSP dust balls, the PS3 baby, the PSP squirrels and all of the David Lynch PS2 commercials. Nintendo Power magazine had some creative and sometimes scary adverts, but the UK never got Nintendo Power, so I didn\u2019t get to see any of them. We got some terrible Sega commercials in the UK though, so enjoy that, just like the Sega CD commercial. There\u2019s a Sonic McDonald\u2019s commercial, the infamous Mighty No. 9 trailer, an awful 3 minute long Hey You Pikachu commercial, it never stops. You\u2019d think there\u2019d be some good ones in here like the original D3ad Island trailer and the Nintendo Wii Wii Would Like to Play commercials and the Halo 3 trailer with Chopin in the background - and no. They get passing mentions, since we\u2019re mostly talking about the bad ones. Sorry about that. There\u2019s even a few banned commercials in here too, from Call of Duty banned commercial to D3ad or Alive banned commercial to Resident Evil 4 banned commercial. Then there\u2019s the silly ones like Your Mom Hates Dead Space 2. Either way, please enjoy. I know I did.\n\n\nWatch more comedy game reviews like my video game commercials review on my channel! | Caddicarus\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/Caddicarus\n\n#Commercials #Toonami #Nintendo #Playstation #nintendopower", "duration": 3198.0, "thumbnail": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9Vge89sOYqc/maxresdefault.jpg", "tags": ["playlist: The Caddicarus Show"], "series": "none", "episode": 6, "category": "essay"}, {"id": "brq4waM3JUc", "author": "Caddicarus", "title": "The Legendary World of Spyro Games - Caddicarus", "description": "I did it.

I said at 1 million subs I would do a Caddicarus Spyro review since 2012, and now the time has come - but over the years it has gone from a Spyro Trilogy retrospective to a single video about all the classic Spyro games to a Spyro Reignited comparison to Spyro PS1 talking about all the differences, but with my current Caddy style, I had to make this one bigger and better, especially for a million subscriber special, so here we are with a complete history of Spyro as we look at every single Spyro game from the original Spyro PS1 gameplay to Spyro Enter the Dragonfly PS2 gameplay to ALL of the Spyro GBA gameplay from Season of Ice to Spyro Orange walkthrough, to Spyro A Hero\u2019s Tail review and Spyro Shadow Legacy review with the Spyro Nintendo DS game, to the entire Legend of Spyro Trilogy from A New Beginning up until Dawn of the Dragon review on the Xbox 360 and even up until Skylanders Spyro\u2019s Adventure review without Skylanders Crash Bandicoot gameplay this time - we\u2019re going back to the original and seeing how it holds up. No PS4 Spyro Reignited Trilogy review here with Spyro Reignited Trilogy gameplay and sadly no Enter the Dragonfly Remastered stuff which I\u2019ve heard a lot about - this is mainly a look at Spyro gameplay, Spyro 2 review with Spyro 2 gameplay, Spyro 3 review with Spyro 3 gameplay all via my original PlayStation copies, alongside the Gameboy Advance Spyro GBA games and the rest. I did used to play Reignited Trilogy PS4 Pro but nowadays I use the Steam and Reignited Trilogy PC gameplay version - did you guys know it runs better on the Steam Deck than on the PS4? Yeah, Spyro Reignited Trilogy Steam Deck. What an age we live in.\n\n\nWatch more comedy game reviews like my Spyro review on my channel! | Caddicarus\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/Caddicarus\n\n#Spyro #Caddicarus #PlayStation", "duration": 8676.0, "thumbnail": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/brq4waM3JUc/maxresdefault.jpg", "tags": ["playlist: The Caddicarus Show"], "series": "none", "episode": 7, "category": "essay"}, {"id": "Lz13cxZNTCo", "author": "Caddicarus", "title": "The Exhausting World of Making a Caddicarus Video - Caddicarus", "description": "Now I've shown you how I do things, it's time to do Spyro.

Let's find out. Watch in horror as Caddy shows you the process of how an average Caddicarus video is made. In this special Caddicarus behind the scenes episode, you'll see the video editing software he uses, the camera he uses, the microphone he uses, game capture, and even his streaming fails. How long does it take to make a video, where do I film, is Olly even a real person - all of this AND MORE will become clear after this special World Of video showing you how its made - a day in the life of a YouTuber. This is very similar to when Cinemassacre did a how its made video, isn't it. Sorry AVGN behind the scenes fans, I'll make it up to you. This is how I make YouTube videos. Oh, and there'll also be an exclusive special one-off mini Caddicarus video all about Family Feud PS1 featuring Family Feud PS1 gameplay and a Family Feud PS1 review. I don't think I'll ever be in a position to actually make a segment about Family Fortunes on this channel, so I figured this video would be best. I hope you enjoyed this overly complicated a day in the life of Caddicarus and show just how much effort is put into being a youtuber, just like all the others I follow like Jirard The Completionist, Didyouknowgaming, and PeanutButterGamer. \r\n\r\n\r\nCaddicarus logo by Jan Animation = https://www.youtube.com/user/jananimationstudios\r\nOLLY'S CAMERA WORK! = http://vimeo.com/ollyross\r\n\r\nPeek into the life of a youtuber with my Caddicarus behind the scenes!

There's 2003 Crash 2 Advance gameplay to see, Crash Bandicoot Advance 4 gameplay, 8 bit Crash Bandicoot NES gameplay from the entire knockoff PS1 console - the Family Karaoto - Crash Bandicoot Sega Genesis gameplay or Crash Bandicoot Mega Drive gameplay for others, and a mass amount of other ripoff Crash Bandicoot games with Google Play bootleg apps and iPhone App Store ripoff games such as a crossover with Angry Birds.

Get ready for Caddicarus The Movie - we breached 90 minutes. 809 shots were filmed covering 9 hours and 21 minutes worth of total filmed footage to get this done - and all so that I could show off all of the worst PS1 accessories and worst PS1 controllers you can find. Or the best PS1 accessories and best PS1 controllers - it\u2019s really up to you. PlayStation accessories are weird. PlayStation controllers are great. Caddy shows off everything here from the Optec Cockpit controller and Jet De Go controller to the G Con 45 light and Madcatz steering wheel. From the PS1 link cable for Wipeout 2097 multiplayer to the Guitar Freaks controller that would go on to inspire Guitar Hero and Rockband. He plays everything he\u2019s supposed to like Die Hard Trilogy light gameplay, Point Blank light gameplay, Resident Evil Survivor light gameplay and Time Crisis light gameplay - but then also doesn\u2019t, like using the Jungle Book dance mat or PS1 dance mat to play Spyro 3 and Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2. He\u2019ll play Reel Fishing 2 with the PS1 fishing rod, but also play Nightmare Creatures with it. He\u2019ll play Densha De Go PS1 gameplay with the PS1 train controller, but also try out Legacy of Kain Soul Reaver gameplay and Rollcage gameplay. There\u2019s the Beatmania controller for Beatmania PS1 gameplay looking very similar to DJ Hero, there\u2019s the Pop n Music controller for Pop n Music arcade gameplay that would be ported as Pop n Music PS1. The Ascii Grip One Handed controller for PS1 one handed controller goodness, a Japanese only Tekken 3 arcade stick for Tekken arcade action at home with Tekken 3 PS1 joystick goodness, the Wu Tang Clan controller made especially for Wu Tang Clan Shaolin Style gameplay also known as Wu Tang Taste the Pain PS1 in PAL regions, the magical motion controller Airpad, and even the Gamester Evolution motion controller that was also on Nintendo 64 as well as PS1 motion controls, there\u2019s a Madcatz third party controller, a Titan Concepts PS1 controller, the Namco PS1 controller sets with the Namco Negcon PS1 and Namco Jogcon PS1, an extremely rare PS1 floppy disk adapter alongside more rare PS1 games and accessories like a matte black Net Yaroze console, Lara Croft PS1 memory card, PS1 LCD screen and Japanese PS1 cell phone adapter for your 90\u2019s PS1 mobile phone adapter - even great things like the PS1 multitap will be shown off, the Pockestation with Pocketstation games and even PS1 mouse for Quake 2 PS1 mouse gameplay, Myst PS1 mouse gameplay, Discworld PS1 mouse, Broken Sword 2 PS1 mouse, Final Doom PS1 mouse - there\u2019s SO MUCH to see and laugh at. And yes\u2026 there\u2019s even the Nintendo Power Glove of the PS1 - the PS1 power glove - the PS1 glove - the PS1 video game control glove. I don\u2019t even need to say any more. PlayStation glove.

The miracles. The walking on water. The feeding of the 5000. The crucifixion. The video games. I didn\u2019t know this. I also didn\u2019t know there were SO MANY OF THEM. SO many Jesus games. PC Jesus video games are absolutely abundant, especially on Steam - and ever since the surprise hilarious reveal of I Am Jesus Christ trailer with a small snippet of I Am Jesus Christ gameplay (you get to fight SATAN IN IT), it inspired me to take a look back and see if anything else was made. As it turns out, it\u2019s a lot. Get ready to be shocked and horrified as we look at Jesus in the Matrix gameplay with Jesus in the Matrix review, Five Loaves and 2 Fishes gameplay, Galilee Spectrum gameplay, yes there are even text adventure games based on religion as far back as the Sinclair ZX Spectrum games, Jesus in Space gameplay, JESUS famicom gameplay that was also JESUS NES gameplay and I managed to get my hand on JESUS MSX2 gameplay, with the MSX2 being the most popular Japanese home computer for original Metal Gear 1, Run Jesus Run gameplay that lasts less than 10 seconds, Jesus Christ RPG review with Jesus Christ RPG PC gameplay, yes, there is an RPG trilogy about Jesus Christ RPG Steam for FREE including a Jesus Christ RPG soundtrack, Fight of Gods PC gameplay with a Fight of Gods review, in fact will Fight of Gods ever come to Xbox or PS5? You can play as Jesus and fight Moses or Santa - so it\u2019s basically South Park Jesus vs Santa but in real life! Save Jesus gameplay with Save Jesus review on PC or Steam, Fist of Jesus PC gameplay even though it\u2019s actually Fist of Jesus Android gameplay with Fist of Jesus review since Fist of Jesus Steam doesn\u2019t exist anymore, Pathway to Jesus iPhone gameplay, Miracles of Jesus PC game gameplay, The You Testament gameplay by MDickie who has a tonne of infamously bad MDickie games for PC, Secrets of Jesus gameplay for Steam with Secrets of Jesus review, and probably my favorite titled one - Fluffy and God\u2019s Amazing Christmas Adventure gameplay. Yes, Fluffy is Jesus\u2019 nickname. I promise. Get ready to watch Caddy leap into action in his cheapest Jesus costume, shouting from car park rooftops, jumping on village brick walls, bouncing on playground see saws, throwing full size toilets and even jumping off of a roof. Caddy jumps off a roof. Yes. You\u2019re gonna want to see this Caddicarus Christmas Special. Happy Holidays, and I hope you enjoy the Caddicarus 2021 season closer - the Caddicarus 2021 Christmas Special.

A few years back, Caddy took a look at a banned PS1 game - or at least, an unreleased PS1 game from the scary world of unreleased games - and no, this isn\u2019t a video game creepypasta talking about lost video games in the deep web or anything unless you\u2019re talking about my brief mention of Sad Satan on the dark web - this was an old video about Thrill Kill, a footnote in the world of controversial games that never was allowed to be released on the PlayStation. This sparked an idea for an even bigger video in which Caddy decided to look online for other games unavailable in the UK or taken off the shelves for various reasons, and point and laugh at them - including ones that were censored, or that have uncensored versions available through\u2026.less than favourable means. Today you\u2019ll be seeing Thrill Kill gameplay with a Thrill Kill review, A Manhunt 2 review featuring Manhunt 2 gameplay on the PS2 with Manhunt PS2 gameplay, Manhunt 2 PC gameplay with tonnes of clips of Manhunt 2 uncensored, Postal 2 gameplay on PC with a Postal 2 review with obvious reasons for Postal 2 banned, Marvel\u2019s The Punisher Xbox gameplay or The Punisher Marvel PS2 gameplay that was censored even though I do include uncensored interrogations and a The Punisher review, Carmageddon PS1 gameplay exclusive to Europe since the Carmageddon 1 PC released was banned for controversy - despite the original Carmageddon censored itself and the PS1 version is basically exactly the same except with zombies - and even some bonuses from a certain BMX PS2 game that I got for the original Xbox in the Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX gameplay series - well, it was more accurately supposed to be Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX 3 before\u2026..stuff happened - and even some Amiga gameplay from a certain Amiga 500 game involving...well, I can\u2019t say, otherwise YouTube will cancel me. But it also came out on the Commodore 64 games list, so maybe that should be enough of a hint.\n\n\nCaddicarus 8bit themes by Endigo = https://www.youtube.com/user/Endigo\n\nCaddicarus logo by Jan Animation = https://www.youtube.com/user/jananimationstudios/videos\n\nKevin MacLeod's royalty free music! = http://incompetech.com\n\nOLLY'S CAMERA WORK! = https://www.youtube.com/OllyRoss\n\n\nWatch more comedy game reviews like my banned games review on my channel! | Caddicarus\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/Caddicarus\n#BannedGames #PlayStation #BannedVideoGames", "duration": 3154.0, "thumbnail": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4YwoRFFiqsQ/maxresdefault.jpg", "tags": ["playlist: The Caddicarus Show"], "series": "none", "episode": 12, "category": "essay"}, {"id": "upSSAtltj1s", "author": "Caddicarus", "title": "The Demonic World of Disney PS1 Games - Caddicarus", "description": "Disney had films.

In this Caddicarus Lilo and Stitch video, for as awful as it was, he took a look at the game in an extremely old review. Obviously. And after that, alongside a few Pixar PS1 games videos like A Bug\u2019s Life PS1 gameplay, Lion King Simba\u2019s Mighty Adventure PS1 gameplay, Aladdin Nasira\u2019s Revenge gameplay, Jungle Book Groove Party gameplay also known as Jungle Book Rhythm n Groove gameplay, Donald Duck Quack Attack PS1 gameplay also known as Goin Quackers PS1, Hercules PS1 gameplay and Party Time with Winnie the Pooh gameplay - Caddy decided it was about time to knock off a huge load of game he wanted to mess around with that he couldn\u2019t do before due to a lack of content for a single video for each. There are a LOT of Disney PS1 games - the PlayStation was the ultimate CD console to fit new Disney movies on with movie clips and scenes in the form of FMV\u2019s. And now here we are with everything from Winnie the Pooh Kindergarten PS1 gameplay to DDR Disney Mix PS1 gameplay, yes, Dance Dance Revolution Disney Mix gameplay. Unfortunately there\u2019s not much DDR Disney Mix OST or  DDR Disney Mix music in this video due to copyright, but what can ya do. Along with this is also Winnie the Pooh Preschool PS1 gameplay because I couldn\u2019t afford Winnie the Pooh Learning, Tigger\u2019s Honey Hunt PS1 gameplay with a Tigger\u2019s Honey Hunt review,  Little Mermaid 2 PS1 gameplay with a Little Mermaid 2 PS1 review, Disney\u2019s Story Studio Mulan PS1 gameplay with a Disney Story Studio Mulan PS1 review - by the way, I really miss you Disney Animated Storybook 101 Dalmatians, Toy Story and Lion King - 101 Dalmatians 2 PS1 gameplay with a 101 Dalmatians 2 PS1 review, 102 Dalmatians PS1 gameplay with a 102 Dalmatians PS1 review, Peter Pan Return to Never Land PS1 gameplay with a Peter Pan Return to Neverland PS1 review - not to mention the PAL variant, Peter Pan Adventures in Never Land - Walt Disney World Quest Magical Racing Tour PS1 gameplay and not Magical Racing Tour Dreamcast gameplay, Treasure Planet PS1 gameplay with a Treasure Planet PS1 review even though I have more memories with Treasure Planet PS2, Disney\u2019s Dinosaur PS1 gameplay with a Dinosaur PS1 review, Emperor\u2019s New Groove PS1 gameplay with an Emperor\u2019s New Groove PS1 review, Goofy\u2019s Fun House PS1 gameplay with a Goofy\u2019s Fun House PS1 review, Mickey\u2019s Wild Adventure PS1 gameplay also known as Mickey Mania SNES gameplay and Mickey Mania Sega Genesis gameplay with a Mickey Mania review, Magical Tetris Challenge PS1 gameplay, My Disney Kitchen PS1 gameplay with a My Disney Kitchen review, Atlantis PS1 gameplay with an Atlantis The Lost Empire review, and even Dancing Stage Disney Mix PS1 gameplay with Dancing Stage PS1 songs. Well, Disney songs at least. No Disney singalong though. Or Disney karaoke. In fact, Dancing Stage is what we used to call Dance Dance Revolution - so Dancing Stage Disney Mix music is better known as DDR Disney Mix, but you\u2019re not reading this, are you, so who cares.\n\n\nCaddicarus 8bit themes by Endigo = https://www.youtube.com/user/Endigo\n\nCaddicarus logo by Jan Animation = https://www.youtube.com/user/jananimationstudios/videos\n\nKevin MacLeod's royalty free music! = http://incompetech.com\n\nOLLY'S CAMERA WORK! = https://www.youtube.com/OllyRoss\n\n\nWatch more comedy game reviews like my Disney PS1 games review on my channel! | Caddicarus\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/Caddicarus\n\n\n\n#PS1 #Disney #DisneyGames #PS1Games #PS1DisneyGames #BadGames #WorstGames", "duration": 4079.0, "thumbnail": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/upSSAtltj1s/maxresdefault.jpg", "tags": ["playlist: The Caddicarus Show"], "series": "none", "episode": 13, "category": "essay"}, {"id": "N-AF_U98pYw", "author": "Caddicarus", "title": "The Stupid World of Portable Crash Bandicoot Games - Caddicarus", "description": "What do you mean it\u2019s July?

Caddicarus is FINALLY back in the first Caddicarus episode about Crash Bandicoot for 2021. The PC problems may be awful, but at least those PC issues can\u2019t get in the way of Bandicoot Month! Today, as Caddicarus Crash Bandicoot review videos seem to go down okay (even though I don\u2019t classify my stuff as reviews anymore) I figured it would be fun to carry on from my old Crash Bandicoot XS review or Crash Bandicoot The Huge Adventure review on the Gameboy Advance, and naturally take a shot at a Crash 2 N Tranced review on GBA. But hey, a Caddicarus Crash 2 N Tranced review on its own is no fun. And how about a Caddicarus Crash Purple review? Crash Fusion? I did do a video on Spyro Orange or Spyro Fusion on the GBA, so that makes sense to show off Crash Bandicoot Gameboy Advance gameplay on all fronts - including Crash Nitro Kart GBA. But then, we went down the rabbit hole. If I was already gonna cover all the Nintendo Gameboy games in 1 video, then why not look at the Nintendo DS Crash Bandicoot games? There\u2019s Crash Boom Bang gameplay with a Crash Boom Bang review (again, not really a review, but I don\u2019t know what else to call it for YouTube to recognise the stupid stuff I do), and even Crash of the Titans DS gameplay, Mind Over Mutant DS gameplay, and then OH MY, there\u2019s also the Crash Bandicoot PSP games! Tag Team Racing PSP gameplay with a Tag Team Racing review, Mind Over Mutant PSP gameplay, Crash of the Titans PSP gameplay - and no, it doesn\u2019t end there. Did you know that Tiger Electronics had a crash game? Yep, the Tiger LCD Games that the AVGN made infamous - they got their mitts on Cash Banooca. From Angry Video Game Nerd Tiger Electronics to Caddy - get ready to see Crash Bandicoot 99x, which was actually the first ever portable crash game. Tiger Electronics Crash Bandicoot. What. And that\u2019s not all - how about the free McDonald\u2019s Happy Meal games? Crash Bandicoot Happy Meal and Spyro Happy Meal games were a thing - CRASH BANDICOOT MCDONALDS GAMES ARE A THING, WHAT. Oh, and then there\u2019s the Crash Bandicoot Java games like Mutant Island gameplay, Crash Bandicoot ExEn gameplay with an Infusio emulator - Java Mobile phone games had crash, with lots of Twinsanity Mobile versions, and then there\u2019s Nitro Kart 3D iOS and Nitro Kart 2 iOS - and speaking of iPhone, we even round off with a Crash On the Run review with Crash on the Run gameplay for the iPhone, even though it\u2019s also Android as well as iOS. I\u2019m gonna sleep now, this was an effort to type.\n\n\nCaddicarus 8bit themes by Endigo = https://www.youtube.com/user/Endigo\n\nCaddicarus logo by Jan Animation = https://www.youtube.com/user/jananimationstudios/videos\n\nKevin MacLeod's royalty free music! = http://incompetech.com\n\nOLLY'S CAMERA WORK! = https://www.youtube.com/SuperOllyRoss\n\n\nWatch more comedy game reviews like my Crash on the Run review on my channel! | Caddicarus\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/Caddicarus\n\n#CrashBandicoot #Bandicoot #Caddicarus #PSP #GBA #GameBoy", "duration": 4703.0, "thumbnail": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/N-AF_U98pYw/maxresdefault.jpg", "tags": ["playlist: The Caddicarus Show"], "series": "none", "episode": 14, "category": "essay"}, {"id": "6rIE5FpqjT8", "author": "Caddicarus", "title": "The Horrible World of Kinect Games - Caddicarus", "description": "17 Kinect Games. 1 tired Caddy.

Caddicarus is FINALLY back in the first Caddicarus episode of 2021. I know it\u2019s April, but as many of you already know, my PC problems have been unbelievable all year. So what better way to come back than with some of the worst games ever made? More specifically - worst Kinect games ever made? From Harry Potter to Star Wars and Sonic the Hedgehog to Steel Battalion - yes - we\u2019re going to be going through a dumpload of Microsoft Kinect games for the Xbox 360, and looking at some of the worst Kinect games of all time. Which is weird, since despite all of the Kinect E3 cringe and Kinect reveal during the Project Natal release - and all of the lies surrounding Project Milo, Star Wars, Kinectimals and SO much more - the Kinect technology became a huge success for Microsoft, and is being continued to this day with Xbox One systems - even though the Xbox One reveal with always-on Kinect was one of the worst things Microsoft ever did. You\u2019ve all seen the Crowbcat Kinect video, it\u2019s called the dark age of Xbox for a reason.There may be some gems in there such as The Gunstringer review with Gunstringer gameplay and even the Kinect Sports review and Kinect Adventures review with Kinect Sports gameplay and Kinect Adventures gameplay - but then we have the other Xbox 360 Kinect games. Kinect Star Wars review with Kinect Star Wars gameplay. Kinect Disneyland Adventures review with Disneyland gameplay. Kinect Harry Potter review with Harry Potter Kinect gameplay. Sonic Free Riders review with Sonic Free Riders gameplay. Rise of Nightmares review with Rise of Nightmares gameplay. Hulk Hogan\u2019s Main Event. Raving Rabbids. Toy Story Mania. Star Wars Kinect. Oh wait, I already said that one. JonTron did that one already, right? Anyway, don\u2019t expect to see any walkthrough or guide especially for the more linear adventures like Rise of Nightmares - and don\u2019t expect an Angry Joe rant with Angry Joe Kinect review videos - this is me, this is 17 Xbox games using awful motion controls, and all we have left is Galactic Dance Off. Sorry, no Michael Jackson Experience or Fantasia Music Evolved here - copyright isn\u2019t fun.\n\n\n\nCaddicarus 8bit themes by Endigo = https://www.youtube.com/user/Endigo\n\n\nCaddicarus logo by Jan Animation = https://www.youtube.com/user/jananimationstudios/videos\n\n\nKevin MacLeod's royalty free music! = http://incompetech.com\n\n\nOLLY'S CAMERA WORK! = https://www.youtube.com/SuperOllyRoss\n\n\nWatch more comedy game reviews like my Xbox 360 Kinect review on my channel! | Caddicarus\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/Caddicarus\n\n#Kinect #KinectGames #Xbox #XboxKinect #KinectSports", "duration": 3895.0, "thumbnail": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6rIE5FpqjT8/maxresdefault.jpg", "tags": ["playlist: The Caddicarus Show"], "series": "none", "episode": 15, "category": "essay"}, {"id": "yrNzgagLJ-w", "author": "Caddicarus", "title": "The Expensive World of the PS5 Launch - Caddicarus", "description": "My final video of the year - I hope you all enjoy it as I go broke over the sake of a PS5.

This means only one thing - a stupidly long video to close off a stupidly long year. The bricks have been relentless. After spending way too much money - nearly \u00a3900 - on the brand new PS5 right after the PS5 reveal and PS5 teaser trailer dropped, I felt like a video review needed to be made. Not just of the system, the PS5 specs or the PS5 hardware, but the PS5 launch titles that would get you set up over the holiday season. Why? Because this stuff is expensive, and with out of stock messages everywhere and consoles selling out to dirty scalpers on eBay, I wanted to let you all know what I thought of the PlayStation 5 before you got too stressed trying to buy one yourself. Today we\u2019ll be covering Bugsnax PS5 featuring Bugsnax gameplay with a Bugsnax review, a Demon\u2019s Souls PS5 review about the Demon\u2019s Souls remake with Demon\u2019s Souls PS5 gameplay, a Sackboy A Big Adventure review with Sackboy A Big Adventure gameplay, a Spider Man Miles Morales review with Spider Man PS5 gameplay running at a consistent 60 fps - which goes for every single one of these games sometimes even at 4k resolution and not just full HD 1080p - an Astro\u2019s Playroom review with Astro\u2019s Playroom gameplay, a Godfall review with Godfall gameplay, an Overcooked PS5 review with Overcooked All You Can Eat gameplay, and an Assassin\u2019s Creed Valhalla review with Assassin\u2019s Creed Valhalla PS5 gameplay. I hope you enjoy my little send off to such an awful year, and I\u2019ll be back soon. Right now, I need fast food and sleep.

And I don\u2019t mean because it\u2019s a Crash video that isn\u2019t on Bandicoot Month. Caddicarus has returned after 1 month of absence - and he\u2019s bigger than ever. The video, I mean. Towering at nearly 90 minutes, basically feature-length, Caddy now brings you his in-depth Crash Bandicoot 4 review. After the meddling Wrath of Cortex, Crash went on a massive downward spiral, eventually ending in the boring Crash of the Titans and Crash Mind Over Mutant. But now he\u2019s back, with a true spiritual sequel to Crash Bandicoot 3 or Crash Bandicoot Warped - Crash 4! Crash Bandicoot 4 It\u2019s About Time is a fantastic game, make no mistake. BUT\u2026.completing Crash 4 has proven to be an exercise of pure unbridled misery. Watch in horror as Caddy dives deeper than he ever has with his Crash Bandicoot 4 critique and the arduous journey the 106 percent completion is. Luckily we\u2019re at least using the PS4 Pro for a crazily beautiful game, which I was expecting after seeing the visuals in the Crash 4 trailer. The Crash Bandicoot 4 trailer may have got me excited, the announcement of which I ended up streaming for over 2 hours in a giant analysis of every frame, but going into making this video for the Crash 4 review was something else entirely. Unfortunately, I can\u2019t give you a Crash Bandicoot 4 guide or Crash Bandicoot 4 walkthrough for some of the hidden boxes and n sanely perfect relics - and I also can\u2019t give you many hints on getting the Crash 4 platinum relics from the Crash 4 time trials. As for the Toys for Bob time trial dev times, or the time trial purple relics - I\u2019M NEVER DOING THEM EVER, SO DON\u2019T ASK MEEEEEEEE. The footage you\u2019ll be seeing in this Crash Bandicoot 4 It\u2019s About Time review was all captured from a PS4 Pro at 60fps, and Crash Bandicoot 4 PS4 is definitely the way I\u2019d recommend playing it. I haven\u2019t seen it running on Xbox One, but if anything, I\u2019m more surprised Crash 4 PS4 is the best way to play this, considering the N Sane Trilogy PS4 was locked at 30fps. A Crash Bandicoot PS4 remake isn\u2019t as smooth as a brand new Crash Bandicoot 4, that isn\u2019t Wrath of Cortex. Weird. Either way - Crash seems to have found his groove finally, even if it was at the tail-end of the PS4 lifecycle. Now, I\u2019d absolutely LOVE to see Crash Team Racing Nitro Fuelled PC, Crash Bandicoot 4 PC (or Crash Bandicoot 4 Switch), and maybe even a PS5 remake or Crash Bandicoot PS5 remake of Crash Twinsanity? Crash Twinsanity Remake, anyone? Crash Twinsanity 2? Who knows. Either way, I think the days of Bad Crash Bandicoot Games are behind us.\n\n\nCaddicarus 8bit themes by Endigo = https://www.youtube.com/user/Endigo\n\nCaddicarus logo by Jan Animation = https://www.youtube.com/user/jananimationstudios/videos\n\nKevin MacLeod's royalty free music! = http://incompetech.com\n\nOLLY'S CAMERA WORK! = https://www.youtube.com/SuperOllyRoss\n\n\nWatch more comedy reviews like my Crash Bandicoot 4 review on my channel! | Caddicarus\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/Caddicarus\n\n#CrashBandicoot #Crash4 #CrashBandicoot4 #Caddicarus", "duration": 5015.0, "thumbnail": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5yapbT_FgFQ/maxresdefault.jpg", "tags": ["playlist: The Caddicarus Show"], "series": "none", "episode": 17, "category": "essay"}, {"id": "0fFfx7kWPLU", "author": "Caddicarus", "title": "The Awful World of Skateboarding Games - Caddicarus", "description": "I played 32 skateboarding games, and most of them are awful.

Tony Hawk OST man, you can\u2019t beat em. After getting nostalgic about Tony Hawk\u2019s Underground 2 Remix PSP and Tony Hawk\u2019s American Sk8land DS, or is it American Skateland DS? Why wasn\u2019t it called American Wasteland DS? Anyway - he decided to then gather up all his funds and play through 30 odd skateboard games in order to make yet another ridiculously long video review, covering everything from Atari 2600 to Steam and PC. In this compilation video that\u2019s probably longer than a few of the Caddicarus Season videos, you\u2019ll be seeing Skate Boardin\u2019 Atari 2600 gameplay, Airblade PS2 gameplay with an Airblade PS2 review, Skateboard Madness X-treme Edition gameplay with a Skateboard Madness X-treme Edition review. There's Thrasher Skate and Destroy review with Thrasher Skate and Destroy PS1 gameplay - don\u2019t worry, I don\u2019t steal from NakeyJakey - a Tony Hawk\u2019s Pro Skater 1 review with Tony Hawk\u2019s Pro Skater 1 gameplay for the PS1, a Tony Hawk\u2019s Pro Skater 2 review with Tony Hawk\u2019s Pro Skater 2 gameplay for the PS1, a Tony Hawk\u2019s Pro Skater 3 review with Tony Hawk\u2019s Pro Skater 3 Xbox gameplay since it\u2019s better than Pro Skater 3 PS2, a Tony Hawk\u2019s Pro Skater 4 review with Tony Hawk\u2019s Pro Skater 4 Xbox gameplay since it\u2019s better than Pro Skater 4 PS2, a Tony Hawk\u2019s Underground review with Underground Xbox gameplay since it\u2019s better than Underground PS2, same going for Underground 2 Xbox gameplay with my Underground 2 review and no PS2 in sight, a Metal Gear Solid Skateboarding gameplay demonstration from the MGS2 Substance PS2 set - the only place you could get the MGS Skateboarding game for classic MGS2 Skateboarding - and I do think it\u2019s sad that Metal Gear Solid 2 Skateboarding never made it to the HD Collection (which in itself is the same game as Konami Evolution Skateboarding). Then for the first time ever I dive into the NES with Town and Country Surf Designs, or T&C Surf Designs NES gameplay and review - and finally, Skate or Die NES gameplay with a Skate or Die review [did the AVGN do a video on that?? - amazingly enough from the AVGN \u2018s favourite gaming company of all time, LJN. AVGN LJN. So many letters. I may not be an Angry Video Game Nerd, but I now know how to trash bad NES games - so who knows what the future will bring? OH - I also take a quick look at Steam for a Skater XL review and Session review for PC, featuring Skater XL gameplay and Session gameplay. One is early access, and the other I think is on PS4 as well as PC and Steam. These descriptions are as long as my videos now. OH I ALSO FORGOT - Pro Skater is also known as Tony Hawk\u2019s Skateboarding in the UK and Europe, I think. Tony Hawk\u2019s Skateboarding gameplay - that\u2019s what we\u2019ve got. It\u2019s a boring and stupid name. Tony Hawk\u2019s Skateboarding PS1. Say it more and realize how dumb we were.

Today, Caddy takes a look at a massive load of LEGO games - from Lego Rockband to Lego Island 2, and Lego Racers to Lego Star Wars (SO EXCITED FOR LEGO STAR WARS SKYWALKER SAGA). While we review all of these classics and bad games alike, including a revisit to the original Caddicarus Lego Racers review back in 2012, you\u2019ll be able to see some of the worst games ever in the LEGO franchise - but also some hidden gems like LEGO City Undercover. Included in this video will be LEGO Alpha Team gameplay for the Gameboy Color with a LEGO Alpha Team review Bionicle XBOX gameplay with Bionicle XBOX review, possibly more well-known as Bionicle PS2, LEGO City Undercover PC gameplay with LEGO City Undercover review, originally released by Nintendo as LEGO City Undercover Wii U, LEGO Drome Racers gameplay on Gamecube with a LEGO Drome Racers Gamecube review, LEGO Football Mania gameplay with a LEGO Football Mania review on PS2, also known as LEGO Soccer Mania, LEGO Island 2 PS1 review with LEGO Island PS1 gameplay, LEGO Island Xtreme Stunts gameplay with Island Xtreme Stunts review for the PS2, LEGO Knight\u2019s Kingdom GBA gameplay with a LEGO Knight\u2019s Kingdom review for Gameboy Advance, LEGO Racers 2 gameplay with LEGO Racers 2 review, SORRY IT TOOK ME SO LONG TO LOOK AT LEGO RACERS 2 PS2 STUFF. LEGO Racers PS1 gameplay with LEGO Racers PS1 review, LEGO Rock Raiders PS1 gameplay with LEGO Rock Raiders review, LEGO Rockband gameplay with LEGO Rockband review for the random instrument-less Nintendo DS, LEGO Star Wars Complete Saga review with LEGO Star Wars gameplay from the original XBOX and PS2 all the way to the XBOX 360 and eventually PC according to the LEGO Star Wars Skywalker Saga trailer and LEGO Star Wars Skywalker Saga gameplay reveal, LEGO Stunt Rally gameplay for Gameboy Color including LEGO Stunt Rally GB review - and maybe even tiny little sumups of games like Lego Racers Gameboy Color, and even the original LEGO Island 1 on PC. No Legoland PC gameplay today, since I already did a review of it. Sorry for stepping on your roost a little bit, Brutalmoose, but I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll understand. Also, special thanks to LEGO themselves for sending me all of brand new sets from Super Mario - the LEGO Mario builds you sent me are beautiful, and incredibly fun to play with.

Watch out, internet - Caddy is back after his horrific bad Dreamworks games adventure, now ready to jump into the world of bad Pixar games. You\u2019d think with Disney that this wouldn\u2019t be the case, but oh, you\u2019d be wrong. Well, to be fair, there\u2019s a few bits of gold here - but it\u2019s mostly some of the worst games ever. Worst games of all time kind of levels, in some places. In this video and review, sit down and get ready for my deep dive into 20+ Disney Pixar games that are definitely not as good as the Disney Pixar Movies they\u2019re based on. Get ready for Brave Xbox 360 gameplay including the Kinect review, Cars Xbox 360 gameplay and Cars review, Cars 2 Xbox 360 gameplay and Cars review, Cars Mater National Championship Xbox 360 gameplay and Cars Mater National review (yes, there\u2019s a lot of Pixar Cars here, and I\u2019m not sorry), Ratatouille Xbox 360 gameplay, Ratatouille review, Toy Story 3 Xbox 360 gameplay and Toy Story 3 review, Wall E Xbox 360 gameplay and Wall E review, Ratatouille Food Frenzy Nintendo DS gameplay and Food Frenzy review, Toy Story Gameboy gameplay and Toy Story review (not the Toy Story SNES game, don\u2019t worry), Monsters Inc Scare Island PS2 gameplay (or Monsters Inc Scream Team PS1 gameplay) and Monsters Inc Scare Island/Monsters Inc Scream Team review, The Incredibles Xbox gameplay and Incredibles review, The Incredibles Rise of the Underminer gameplay and Rise of the Underminer review - which are both more popular on being The Incredibles PS2 gameplay I\u2019m sure - and I can say the same as Finding Nemo Gamecube gameplay, which was most likely played more as Finding Nemo PS2 gameplay with a Finding Nemo review, Buzz Lightyear of Star Command PS1 gameplay and Star Command review, The Incredibles GBA gameplay and Gameboy Advance review, LEGO Incredibles PC review and LEGO Incredibles gameplay, Pixar Up PSP gameplay and Up review, Cars 3 Driven to Win PS4 gameplay and Cars 3 PS4 review\u2026...basically, there\u2019s a lot here. I even take a very quick look back at previous Disney Pixar games I\u2019ve looked at in the past - I revisit Toy Story 2 PS1 gameplay with a Toy Story 2 PS1 review (and of course, the AMAZING Toy Story 2 PS1 OST and music!), Toy Story Racer PS1 gameplay with Toy Story Racer review, and even A Bug\u2019s Life PS1 gameplay with A Bug\u2019s Life PS1 review (once again, with epic music). Lots of Traveller\u2019s Tales games here, lots of good, lots of bad, and lots of Silicon Graphics Computers.

No, we aren\u2019t looking at the Crash Bandicoot 4 trailer. We\u2019re looking at some of the worst games of all time. Okay, that\u2019s an exaggeration. To conclude Bandicoot Month 2020, here we go - the Caddy videos people have been wanting for 8 years - BAD CRASH BANDICOOT GAMES. Behold as Caddicarus dives into Crash Nitro Kart, Crash Tag Team Racing, Crash of the Titans, Crash Mind Over Mutant and even Skylanders Imaginators Crash Bandicoot figures and Thumpin Wumpa Islands gameplay. Yes, Skylanders - a Spyro game featuring Crash. I\u2019m getting Crash Purple, or Crash Fusion flashbacks. Actually - that one wasn\u2019t as bad as Spyro Orange, or Spyro Fusion. Oh, and Caddy even goes back to one of his first games he reviewed under the original Caddicarus show - Crash Bash. Yes, the Caddicarus Crash Bash review is being redone. It\u2019s been too long, and I can do it better. With the excitement surrounding the announcement of Crash Bandicoot 4 Just In Time, and the incredible Crash Bandicoot 4 reveal, what better way to commemorate that than by addressing the reason they referenced the future Crash games, while at the same time ignoring them? In this giant video - get ready to see the depressing console future of the post Naughty Dog Crash Bandicoot series - featuring a Crash Bash review with Crash Bash gameplay (and even footage of the unlock everything code in Spyro 3 to get to the Crash Bash demo cheat), Crash Nitro Kart review with Crash Nitro Kart gameplay on the PS2, Crash Tag Team Racing review with Crash Tag Team Racing gameplay on the PS2, Skylanders Imaginators review with Skylanders Imaginators gameplay on the PS4 (more accurately, Thumpin Wumpa Islands gameplay), Crash of the Titans review with Crash of the Titans gameplay on the Xbox 360 and Crash Mind Over Mutant review with Crash Mind Over Mutant gameplay on the Xbox 360. By the way, you won\u2019t see a Crash Boom Bang review with Crash Boom Bang gameplay on the DS, or even a Crash Purple review with Crash Purple gameplay on the Gameboy Advance, or in Europe, Crash Fusion review with Crash Fusion gameplay. I\u2019m working on a Portable Crash Bandicoot games video for next year, so those worst games ever won\u2019t be looked at until then. Got some PSP games and more GBA games there, too - I never did look at N Tranced. I really do love the Crash figure and Cortex figure for Skylanders, though - so you get to see Crash AND Cortex gameplay there too.

For the first video of June 2020, watch as Caddy slowly goes mad as he gets every single platinum relic in the Crash Bandicoot series. Every single one. All 202. No gold relic or sapphire relic in sight. From PS1 to GBA, and PS2 to Steam and PS4. From N Sane Trilogy platinum relics on Crash 1 and Crash 2, to platinum relics on Crash Team Racing Nitro Fueled and even Crash Nitro Kart and The Huge Adventure GBA, Caddy goes through every single Crash game to grab every time trial relic available at the best possible times. Even the hardest levels, like Hot Coco platinum relic, Hog Ride platinum relic, Stormy Ascent platinum relic, Future Tense platinum relic, Sewer Speedway platinum relic - all of them. Get ready for a massive load of mini top lists for the hardest relics to get on the Crash time trials - in many ways this is essentially a Crash Bandicoot hardest levels video. Anyway, in this footage today, you\u2019ll be seeing N Sane Trilogy PC gameplay, Nitro Kart PS2 gameplay, Crash 2 N Tranced gameplay, Huge Adventure gameplay, Crash Team Racing gameplay (more accurately CTR Nitro Fueled PS4 gameplay PS4), Wrath of Cortex gameplay and even Crash Nitro Kart GBA gameplay. Yes, the Gameboy Advance Nitro Kart counts as a separate game. Different tracks, different controls, different design. Weirdly enough though, you won\u2019t see any Crash Tag Team Racing gameplay though. No time trial relics in that one. In a racing game. Huh. I hope you enjoy the longest video I\u2019ve ever made, and I hope you feel more confident in your platinum relic runs, or even gold relic and sapphire relic runs - because if I can do it, anybody can. Featuring Crash 1 platinum relics, Crash 2 platinum relics, Crash 3 platinum relics, CTR platinum relics (Nitro Fueled platinum relics), Nitro Kart platinum relics, Wrath of Cortex platinum relics, Crash XS platinum relics (or Huge Adventure platinum relic), and Crash 2 N Tranced platinum relics. I\u2019m getting tired of saying time trial relic. It\u2019s my birthday, I\u2019m going.

It\u2019s almost as bad as Disney games. There\u2019s just one problem, though - Disney games have some gold in there. Dreamworks games tend not to. I remember playing tonnes of them when I was a kid - mostly on the original Xbox and the PS2. Shrek 2 Xbox, Shrek Superslam PS2, Madagascar Xbox, Over the Hedge PS2, Shark Tale PS2 - I was kind of obsessed back in the day. The crazy thing though, is that despite playing all these games for HOURS back then, and finishing them all 100%.... I don\u2019t remember anything about them. There\u2019s a few gems like Shrek 2 PS2 and even from the likes of Shrek Superslam gameplay, but as a whole, my memories from Dreamworks games have been mixed to terrible. Then we get modern day rubbish like some of the worst kinect games ever, like Penguins of Madagascar. I\u2019m at least glad I didn\u2019t get to see the likes of Shrek Treasure Hunt PS1, though. Because oh, man. In this video, I\u2019ll be diving into nearly 20 dreamworks games - so get ready to see Shark Tale gameplay, Shrek 2 gameplay, Shrek Superslam gameplay, Over the Hedge gameplay, Hammy Goes Nuts DS, Turbo DS, How to Train Your Dragon 2 gameplay, Kung Fu Panda gameplay, Bee Movie gameplay (no Bee Movie Memes, sorry), Shrek Treasure Hunt gameplay, Madagascar gameplay, Antz Extreme Racing gameplay, Shrek Extra Large gameplay (a horrific remake of Shrek 1 Xbox), Shrek Super Party gameplay, Penguins of Madagascar gameplay (ON THE KINECT, OH JOY), and even Dreamworks Super Star Kartz gameplay. Nearly every system is covered, too - PS2, PS1 Xbox, Xbox 360, Gamecube, Nintendo DS, Kinect, PS3 - the whole shabang. No console is safe from Oscar in Shark Tale. No mind is safe from any Dreamworks cinematic disaster. Not even video games.\n\nCaddicarus 8bit themes by Endigo = https://www.youtube.com/user/Endigo\n\nCaddicarus logo by Jan Animation = https://www.youtube.com/user/jananimationstudios/videos\n\nKevin MacLeod's royalty free music! = http://incompetech.com\n\nOLLY'S CAMERA WORK! = https://www.youtube.com/SuperOllyRoss\n\n\nWatch more comedy reviews like my worst games of all time on my channel! | Caddicarus\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/Caddicarus\n\n#DreamWorks #Shrek #KungFuPanda", "duration": 3138.0, "thumbnail": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ec-9WnQQiLw/maxresdefault.jpg", "tags": ["playlist: The Caddicarus Show"], "series": "none", "episode": 23, "category": "essay"}, {"id": "a26dqWTOdFk", "author": "Caddicarus", "title": "The Comical World of the 287 WORST Game Reviews Ever - Caddicarus", "description": "Well, more accurately, Caddy watched 555 worst game reviews.

No exageration. These might very well be more than a load bad game reviews - we\u2019re not talking Irate Gamer - no AVGN rip offs - this is public access tv. It\u2019s creepy, it\u2019s unsettling, and it\u2019s not very well written or presented - it\u2019s Gaming in the Clinton Years - formerly known as Flights of Fantasy, and presented by the great George Wood. Filled with questionable statements, best quotes and plenty of fodder for all of your out of context twitter accounts - get ready to absorb every minute of the time Caddy had to watch 555 (in total) youtube videos in order to find the worst ever. Doesn\u2019t even matter if there\u2019s no context - they\u2019re still the worst game reviews of all time. You\u2019ll see. Special thanks to the NAVGTR youtube channel for archiving Flights of Fantasy and starting the George Wood ARG, and thanks for acronyming the show to \u2018GITCY\u2019. Cos that\u2019s funny.

So now we have all the time in the world to self-reflect and catch up on backlog viewing material. Netflix, Amazon Prime, YouTube\u2026..yourself. There\u2019s nothing quite like hindsight, is there? Well, Caddy seems to think so, because today he\u2019ll be watching the worst video ever. Sorry, the worst videos ever. Plural. The worst videos on YouTube\u2026..his own ones. From the depths of mid to late 2011, it\u2019s time to review the worst youtube videos of all time - the Caddicarus old videos. From when he was 16/17 years old, had no clue what he was doing, and made everyone cry with how terrible he was. A lot of these videos are all available at the Caddy Plays channel - saved into an archive playlist after they were taken down from the main channel after the Rascal Racers review - which you can see right here http://www.youtube.com/CaddyPlays - but there are double that amount that we\u2019ll be looking at today - because of the separate vlog videos connected to the archive videos that Caddy never wanted you to remember. They are proper cringe. In fact, I was gonna name this video to match it up with a cringe compilation or something - they aren\u2019t only the worst videos on youtube, but the cringiest videos of all time too - so it felt only right to sit down today as I review each and every single aspect of old school Caddicarus.

After waking up with tiny hands, he can now ONLY play games made for babies and toddlers on the PS1. Preschool video games have a rocky history, and continue to do so even today. Even though just saying that these are video games for preschoolers is enough to make your stomach turn. AVGN has looked at some, even PeanutButterGamer or PBG has, so it\u2019s clearly something people like to see. Baby video games and toddler video games have been around ever since the days of the Atari 2600 and Colecovision, and in my opinion, they have always been nothing but a cash grab or sellout. By design, video game consoles are not meant for very young children. The controllers are the wrong size, the systems are often too delicate for sticky and clumsy hands to operate and they often require a decent level of reading skills and hand eye coordination to get enjoyment from. They were not built in the same way that Fisher Price or Vtech toys were - there were family-friendly games, but this was an industry meant for kids, teens and adults. Not toddlers. That\u2019s why, when you see a game about Sesame Street, you get confused as to who would actually buy it. And that answer, in my opinion, is guilty parents spending too much time on the console and want to justify their purchase with video games for their youngest children. These games are too insultingly simple, too overpriced and provide NOTHING for anybody else in a family, so they are just there to be purchased to get the kids to shut up. Video game babysitting, basically. What\u2019s the point of creating a functional or engaging expensive game when you can just plaster Peppa Pig on the cover, and wait for the money to roll in from the parents who don\u2019t know any better, or are just letting their kids nag them into buying them? It\u2019s ingenious, really. CD\u2019s are cheap to produce and copy as well, WAY better than big cuddly toys. I mean, at least NES cartridges for Nintendo Systems were on a console with a simple controller - but a PS1 controller? With its awkward shape, analog sticks, d pad, start and select button, stick push-in buttons, 4 face buttons and 4 trigger buttons? WHAT WERE THEY THINKING. KIDS GAMES. REALLY. Anyway - get ready for some quality gameplay today, everyone. In this feature, you will find an Elmo\u2019s Number Journey review with Elmo\u2019s Number Journey gameplay, Elmo\u2019s Letter Adventure review with Elmo\u2019s Letter Adventure gameplay, Barbie Race and Ride review with Barbie Race and Ride gameplay, Barbie Explorer review with Barbie Explorer gameplay (which PBG or PeanutButterGamer took a look at), Rayman Junior review with Rayman Junior gameplay or Rayman Brain Games review with Rayman Brain Games gameplay (which AntDude took a look at), Easter Bunny\u2019s Big Day review with Easter Bunny\u2019s Big Day gameplay, Bear in the Big Blue House review with Bear in the Big Blue House gameplay, Fisher Price Rescue Heroes PS1 review with Rescue Heroes PS1 gameplay that was based on the Molten Menace set, Sesame Street Sports review with Sesame Street Sports gameplay, and probably in the most confusing name change overseas, a Party Time with Winnie the Pooh review with Party Time with Winnie the Pooh gameplay\u2026\u2026.which in the US, is called Disney Pooh\u2019s Party Game in Search of the Treasure review, with Disney Pooh\u2019s Part Game in Search of the Treasure gameplay.

I do. But I equally remember the magic - or more accurately, strangeness - of the Official UK PlayStation Magazine, which is where the PS1 demo discs and even PS2 demo discs came from in the first place if you lived in the UK. There was a US edition, plenty of spin offs and unofficial magazines, and even alternatives for other consoles like Nintendo Power, but this isn\u2019t them, and you aren\u2019t watching AVGN. Angry Video Game Nerd, sorry. Reading a PS1 magazine or a PS2 magazine was like reading your favourite book, if somebody kept on updating it because of new information. This magazine not only hid all of the classic PS1 demo discs that I talked about in my demo disc review video, but ended up becoming the best selling gaming magazine IN THE WORLD by 1999 after featuring a Metal Gear Solid review and Metal Gear Solid demo. The success never reached those levels again, but the magazine itself is still going today and managed to survive through the dawn of the internet, eventually ending up into the Official PS3 Magazine and nowadays the Official PS4 Magazine. I\u2019m saying \u2018official\u2019 a lot because I think it\u2019s important to stress that this wasn\u2019t a third party magazine - it was Sony licensed, and as the magazine transitioned from PS1 to PS2, I\u2019m surprised it was still Sony approved. Like any time a franchise or product reaches its highest sales volumes ever, this also means sales eventually do drop - and when this happens, to try to recreate initial high sales volumes in the early years, sometimes you end up completely losing it and forgetting what made you so successful in the first place. I bring this up due to what ends up happening to the Official PlayStation magazine - form the PS1 to PS2, it slowly became an adult-oriented and sleazy magazine for lads in a desperate attempt to reinvigorate the hardcore fans and bring in more casual people than ever. You won\u2019t believe what you see towards the end of this video, and won\u2019t believe this was an official publication from the heads of PlayStation themselves. Hotlines galore, inappropriate comments, weird articles, gross pictures, it\u2019s got it all. Get ready for my longest video yet, grab your popcorn, and let\u2019s look at these pages with our mouths gaping open together. Rate Your Mate, indeed. Welcome to the Caddicarus PlayStation magazine review, featuring Metal Gear Solid, Hideo Kojima, Abe\u2019s Odyssey, Abe\u2019s Exoddus, Jak and Daxter, Heart of Darkness, Crash Bandicoot, Spyro, Enter the Matrix, Rascal, Tekken, and plenty of really old Nokia mobile phone ads for Java games and ringtones of early 2000\u2019s hits.\n\n\nCaddicarus 8bit themes by Endigo = https://www.youtube.com/user/Endigo\n\nCaddicarus logo by Jan Animation = https://www.youtube.com/user/jananimationstudios/videos\n\nKevin MacLeod's royalty free music! = http://incompetech.com\n\nOLLY'S CAMERA WORK! = https://www.youtube.com/SuperOllyRoss\n\n\nWatch more comedy game reviews like my PS1 Magazine review and PS2 Magazine review on my channel! | Caddicarus\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/Caddicarus\n#PlayStation #Gaming #PlayStationMagazine", "duration": 2542.0, "thumbnail": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NohJFYbyhcc/maxresdefault.jpg", "tags": ["playlist: The Caddicarus Show"], "series": "none", "episode": 27, "category": "essay"}, {"id": "fYOeXytMwoM", "author": "Caddicarus", "title": "The Wonderful World of PS1 Demo Discs - Caddicarus", "description": "12 hours of recorded PS1 demo footage later, and here Caddy is, making a ridiculous 33 minute epic about the history and majesty of PlayStation demo discs.

I do. The UK never had access to PlayStation Underground, which was a virtual magazine series in the US that shipped a brand new PS1 demo to you every quarter of the year from a subscription - but we DID have access to the monthly Official UK PlayStation Magazine - or OPM. This series of magazines bundled in an exclusive UK PS1 demo disc every month with the latest games, trailers and exclusive behind-the-scenes video footage at a low price. You also got some brilliant examples of a ps1 demo disc menu and even the best ever ps1 demo disc music - seriously, the soundtrack for these demos was insane. So much nostalgia. I even take a brief look at the XBOX Exhibition discs and even the OPS2M demo discs - or more accurately, the Official UK PlayStation 2 demo discs. Yeah, it eventually transitioned into a official PS2 magazine demo disc and then eventually onto an official UK PS3 demo disc, but we\u2019re getting way ahead of ourselves. I miss demos. Did anyone check out the MediEvil PS4 demo? From the MediEvil PS4 trailer? I even did a MediEvil remake review that you can see on the card in the video. You know, it you really want to see a slightly older MediEvil PS4 review. Anyway, as I said at the start of this demo disc video description, this video took me a LONG time to make. 12 hours of footage and over 200 individual trailer/gameplay demos I recorded, and here we are with a MASSIVE 32 minute review about the brilliance of PS Demo Discs. Hope you enjoy it, it surely was a journey for me.

The worst games ever. Okay, maybe I\u2019ve played worse video games, but on the PS Store or PSN, these are certainly the worst, and some of the priciest I\u2019ve ever seen. These are the worst PS4 games of all time. The worst PS4 games ever. And you\u2019d think with all the videos covering the worst Steam games ever, from Slaughtering Grounds to Bad Rats, that the PlayStation Network would be immune to getting games like that on the storefront due to sure financial backing and stronger brand infrastructure. But no. We\u2019ve got some PS4 exclusives and some Steam games as well as PS4 games, but make no mistake, everything here was bought with 115 dollars, and it\u2019s the most expensive sick I\u2019ve ever paid for. Get ready for a big journey as I look at 10 bad games - with a Life of Black Tiger review (made famous by the Life of Black Tiger AVGN video), a Flowers Are Dead review (made famous by Jim Sterling), a Catlateral Damage review (which I think Markiplier played? Who knows? Who cares?), and a collection of reviews from a lovely man called Gilson B Pontes. All hail Gilson B Pontes. Gilson B Pontes will save us. Gilson B Pontes is love. Gilson B Pontes is life. Oh, and there\u2019s a review in here of Skylight Freerange 2 Gachduine review. The best name for a game of all time.
