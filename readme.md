This is a project to make the ultimate Second Screen App.

The plan is to create a web based program that uses Youtube videos to create a schedule, like a TV channel, to take the choice out of your second screen content.

It is in a functional but barebones state at the moment, you can add videos and playlists from youtube, and make schedules for a period of time with some filters available.

For now, it is just with youtube videos, i had previously made a version that ran on locally saved video files but i lost everythign from that, and found that youtube videos would work better to make the application not have to take up space on your hard drive.
